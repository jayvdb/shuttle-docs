This section contains examples for the following frameworks: Warp, Tower, Poem, Rocket, Salvo, Thruster, Poem & Tide.

### Hello World

This example provides a simple "Hello, world!" Rust application that you can deploy with Shuttle. It's a great starting point for learning how to use Shuttle and getting familiar with the deployment process for Rust applications.

In order to get started, initialize your project with `cargo shuttle init` and pick the framework you want to use for this example.

Once you are done, your project should be setup with all the required dependencies so go ahead and copy/paste the relevant code snippet from below into your `main.rs` file.

## Rocket
<CodeGroup>
<Snippet file="rocket-hello-world-src-main-rs.mdx" />
</CodeGroup>

## Tower
<CodeGroup>
<Snippet file="tower-hello-world-src-main-rs.mdx" />
</CodeGroup>

## Warp
<CodeGroup>
<Snippet file="warp-hello-world-src-main-rs.mdx" />
</CodeGroup>

## Salvo
<CodeGroup>
<Snippet file="salvo-hello-world-src-main-rs.mdx" />
</CodeGroup>

## Poem
<CodeGroup>
<Snippet file="poem-hello-world-src-main-rs.mdx" />
</CodeGroup>

## Thruster
<CodeGroup>
<Snippet file="thruster-hello-world-src-main-rs.mdx" />
</CodeGroup>

## Tide
<CodeGroup>
<Snippet file="tide-hello-world-src-main-rs.mdx" />
</CodeGroup>

In order to deploy the example, simply run:

```bash
cargo shuttle deploy
```
