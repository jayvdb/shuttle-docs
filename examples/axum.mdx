This section revolves around simple Axum examples you can get quickly started with by following these 3 steps:
1. Initialize a new Axum project by running the `cargo shuttle init --template axum` command
2. Copy pasting the contents of the example you want to deploy -- make sure to check the tabs of the snippet(s) to ensure you are copying the right code/file
3. Running the `cargo shuttle deploy` command
